“New Research Says Vegetarian Diets Could Actually Be Worse for the Planet,” proclaims a Vice article title in their trademark bolded, Trade Gothic, all-caps letters.

My knee-jerk reaction, as a vegetarian with an environmental conscience, flared up in defense, without even reading the article. Part of Vice’s success has to do with their ability to provoke this reaction in readers. You need not read any further than the clickbait headline to get pissed but, if you do, you’ll encounter a brew of profane language, offensive content, and sweeping generalizations trying to pass itself off as journalism.

Vice has an extensive digital footprint, pulling a whopping 250 million viewers monthly across a number of different publications, not including the 2.2 billion monthly views they have on YouTube, their HBO channel viewership, and Facebook followers.

The pointed “Vegetarian Diets Worse for the Planet” headline snared me in Vice’s trap. Citing research from Carnegie Mellon’s departments of Engineering and Public Policy and Social and Decision Sciences, the article claims, “…a new report in Environment Systems and Decisions argues that vegetarian diets contribute more to climate change than your standard omnivorous fare.”

The research article that they are referencing did not actually analyze vegetarian diets. Instead, it considered the relative resource intensity of three scenarios of dietary change taken from USDA dietary recommendations, which, don’t include vegetarianism. The article clearly states that vegetarianism requires less agricultural emissions and water use than a diet including meat, yet Vice somehow gleaned “vegetarianism is worse for the planet” from it.

Last year Vice released an HBO special called “Killing Cancer.” This particular segment was slightly less inflammatory than usual due to the sanctity of the topic. It featured host Shane Smith, Vice’s Co-Founder, and four treatment profiles of cancer patients who were receiving variations of the CAR T-cell therapy.

Adoptive Cell Transfer (CAR) T-cell therapy is developing out of immunotherapy. The treatment genetically engineers patients’ immune systems to recognize and attack their cancer cells, best to employ for patients who are suffering from B-cell cancers whose treatments have not been successful with traditional chemotherapy or stem cell transplants. This form of therapy has seen some success in restricted clinical trials, but it is still in nascent stages of development.

The first shot of “Killing Cancer” is Smith proclaiming, “We’re actually on the first stages to find a cure for cancer!” This statement is considerably more optimistic than a statement from the chief CAR T-cell therapy researchers, Dr. Kochenderfer and Rosenberg, in their Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology article: “…infusions of anti-CD19 CAR T cells might become a standard therapy for some B-cell malignancies.”

Vice has received considerable criticism from the American Cancer Society and Cleveland Clinic’s Taussig Cancer Center for sensationalizing this treatment. Program director Dr. William C. Phelps said he, “doesn’t want to throw cold water all over this [treatments highlighted in ‘Killing Cancer’], but it’s too early.”

The final nail in the coffin is the 2012 documentary The Vice Guide to Karachi which is what Vice calls “immersive journalism” – that is –Vice correspondents are in the field reporting on the dangers of civilian life in Karachi, Pakistan. Reddit user and Karachi native, chootrangers, took issue with the misreporting of the condition of this area and created an illuminating series of blog posts that chronicle his experiences eating delicious food from outdoor cafes in the same area that Vice’s documentary team allegedly hid from terrorists.

“We’re curing cancer,” “Vegetarians are killing our planet,” and “Karachi is the most dangerous city in Pakistan” have reached a huge constituency. The article was shared over 311 thousand times over Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, and Vice’s HBO series averages 3 million viewers per season.

Good journalism values neutrality over sensationalism. Everybody knows that Vice is provocative, but not everybody knows that Vice isn’t real journalism.

It’s particularly concerning that this misinformation is reaching viewers who wade knee-deep in a Facebook argument based off of loose facts over the sustainability of eating a head of lettuce versus a baker’s dozen of bacon-wrapped hot dogs. Vice preys on the irritability of readers to push their content but brands themselves as a news source striving for objectivity.

The late David Carr, a respected New York Times media columnist, gave a lively quote stating that Vice is, a hell-bent libertarianism and cultural literacy that brings to mind Playboy in its prime, when people came for the pictures, but stayed for the articles.”
