Ken Lum, the artist who designed the East Van Cross, has recently installed a public art piece that is a commentary on Vancouver's famed housing affordability issues. The piece is called "Vancouver Especially" and is a small sculpture replica of the prefab, single-family dwellings which were built from 1965 to 1985 as an affordable housing design for poor families and immigrants called the "Vancouver Special".

"Vancouver Especially" is hosted by a public art space facilitated by artist-run gallery 221A at 271 Union Street in Chinatown, between Gore and Main. Lum's budget for the piece was $45,000 which is approximately the same price of a Vancouver Special in the 1970s.
