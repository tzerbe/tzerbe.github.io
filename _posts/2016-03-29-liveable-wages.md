I think one of the most essential solutions to climate change is the redistribution of wealth. We have had a number of speakers come in to speak with us about different ways we can do this: Seth Klein from the CCPA spoke with us about liveable wages, Wes Regan spoke with us on affordable housing, Elizabeth May spoke with us about universal basic income, Michael Small spoke with us about Carbon taxation, the conversation of corporate taxation and progressive income taxation came up in many conversations in and outside the classroom over the course of the semester, Glen Coulthard spoke with us about reconciling land claims and natural resource claims between the Canadian government and First Nations and Indigenous peoples, and the list goes on.

So many issues that I see in the world today seem to stem from the incredible disparities in wealth and a "growth mindset". Nearly all of these fall under the umbrella of sustainability issues, and, in my mind, are directly linked to climate change and environmental degradation. Wealth redistribution would not be about "raising up" the bottom so that they could live like climate pigs like us, but it would be about curtailing the highest end: people who own natural resources and capital and have been fostering uncontrollable, and exploitative growth with the support of tax breaks and Capitalism.

I can only spew so much anti-Capitalist rhetoric in one day so that's all for now.
