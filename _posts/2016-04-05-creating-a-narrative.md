I think the most important thing I've considered all semester is how narratives are created. Relatedly, I've had my eyes opened to the incompleteness of every single narrative I encounter. Anything that involves the selective parsing and synthesizing of information is narrative-forming: conversation, world views, map making, story telling, data collection, making art, interpreting art, media coverage, language, scientific investigation, law writing, interpreting the law, the visible spectrum of light, physical arrangement of objects in space, and almost everything else I can think of.

It is essential to realize that each and every person is a narrative. Personal narratives are little package of life experiences, worldviews, emotions, and extraneous influences that is interacting with an ever-changing environment. The narratives that we hold are incomplete. Considering this, it is an absolute miracle that we are able to communicate with each other at all, however badly we may do it sometimes.

The definition of dialogue that I am leaving Semester in Dialogue with is the process by which narratives interact. Sometimes, when narratives have significant, misaligned gaps, dialogue is very tense and argumentative and even aggressive. Sometimes the narratives between two parties have a level of synchronicity about them that makes dialogue very easy but also kind of frightening and can lead to the loss of critical re-evaluation of thoughts.  

The most important component of a successful dialogue is the ability of every participant to actively listen to the others. This means that you are making every effort to understand the narratives that the other speakers may represent. You must take into consideration all possible creators and influencers of their narrative, and of your own, and you must be extra careful to conduct yourself in a way that communicates openness and love to them.

Learning how to dialogue is an invaluable life skill. It’s basically learning how to be aware of your place in the world, recognize somebody else’s place in the world, and then try to patiently and lovingly communicate that to one another. I wrote in an earlier reflection about the way that my improved dialogue skills have already been visible in my life outside the classroom – in conversations with my grandmother where we have typically butt heads. My dialogue skills also helped me reconnect with my father who attended our Rewilding event after I haven’t seen him in almost a year and don’t speak to frequently, much less tell about the daily ongoings of my life and my education.

This semester has been amongst the most engaged and enthralled that I’ve ever felt in school. I’ve come to appreciate the value of civic engagement – knowing what’s going around in the community lends itself to a certain level of presence and awareness which can sometimes be terrifying but is an important ingredient to happiness. Thanks Sean, Am, Leah, and Melora for your guidance and resources throughout the semester. I hope you are surprised and excited about the final form of our dialogue!
