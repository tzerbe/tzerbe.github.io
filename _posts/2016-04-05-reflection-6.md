The definition of rewilding from a conservationist’s perspective, Michael Soulè, is, “The scientific argument for restoring big wilderness based on the regulatory roles of large predators. The principal premise is that rewilding is a critical step in restoring self-regulating land communities.” I think the really interesting part of this definition is the bit about self-regulating ecosystems. What does it mean if we include humans (as we should) in our conception of these ecosystems that need to be rewilded? I think it suggests that we need to break down systems of complete dependency whereby certain actors are forced to depend on a negligent “provider”. Rewilding can be used analogously to help think through wicked problems and find potential solutions.

I think two things need to be present for rewilding to be accomplished: each player in the ecosystem has to be self-sustaining and be given agency, and also the whole ecosystem has to work together harmoniously (which seems like kind of a contradiction, I know). It is kind of like an acid trip. It includes taking great interest in the absolute tiniest things but also realizing the intrinsic connectedness of everything. For this reason, I think the metaphor of rewilding also has the potential to address a number of other issues that are seen as more “pressing” on micro and macro scales.
