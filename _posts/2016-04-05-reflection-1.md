One sustainable development project that I am inspired by is Local Code spearheaded by Nicholas de Monchaux with sponsorship from UCLA CityLab. The project aims to model, through Geographic Information Systems, the location and ecological/thermodynamic characteristics of “legally and socially abandoned lots” that are owned by the city of San Francisco. Inspired by the emerging “urban acupuncture” design theory, this project seeks to revive these sites as micro-parks and urban lounges to promote localized development for public use, stormwater management, increasing civic engagement, air quality improvement, etc. Multifaceted projects such as these that recognize the intrinsic linkages between environmental and social issues inspire me. In addition, Local Code seeks to make these improvements in a democratic way without the energy-intensive process of upturning large urban areas.

Our discussion about the structure of our education and the function of dialogue-based learning interested me. In particular, we discussed the relative importance of learning the theoretical/technical background to a subject vs. applying the subject matter in “real life”. I come from a science/social science background and thus am generally required to have a technical knowledge of some things (i.e. data analysis, existing scientific findings, scientific method, etc.) I had not considered that, in some subjects, it is not necessary or entirely positive to learn the theoretical/technical aspects. It seems that this emphasis on lecture-based learning and somewhat blind acceptance of past knowledge could create a relationship of superiority/inferiority between the teacher and student.
