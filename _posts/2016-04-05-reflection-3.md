This week has been challenging and intense on a personal level and, apparently, also on a group dynamic level. However, I think I left before some of that intensity surfaced on Thursday/Friday (I was filled in by some of my peers).  So, I cannot speak directly to these events but I do have some general thoughts on our group dynamic and opportunities for growth:

  •	I noticed pretty much right away this semester that there seems to be a lot of egotism present in our dialogue. It is understandable that, as a group of driven university students participating in a selective program, we are all fairly reassured of our relative intelligence. However, I think it is really inhibiting our active listening abilities. It is evident sometimes in tone and the fact that we are sometimes not building off of each other’s thoughts in conversation, but just proposing our own ideas in a sort of discombobulated way. 	
      o	Ways we could address this: Do a little introspection and make sure that we are coming to the dialogue with humbled, open minds. Be super aware of our tone/facial expressions/body language. Take opportunities to pick up on something someone else says and try to expand it/understand it.
  •	There are some very strong voices in the group that sometimes are a bit domineering. We have talked a little bit about those voices realizing their role and making space for other voices to be heard, but then the responsibility falls equally on quiet voices to speak up and without fear.
      o	For me, personally, this means not simply disengaging when I feel overridden by other individuals, asking for clarification when our pace is too fast and I don’t know what decisions have been reached, etc. Also, I think creating a less ego-driven space (objective of bullet #1) will make participation more accessible for those less frequented voices.
