The very first thing I noticed when I moved to Vancouver was the monumental size of the hedges that grow here. They are practically the height of houses and match them in geometric precision. They are trimmed into the most unnatural shapes like rectangles, triangles, cones, and perfectly rounded domes, even stars!

To me, the hedge is a very important and telling cultural artifact. Their existence sheds light on some interesting North American/Western cultural neurosis like our obsession with separating the “private” from the “public” and intentional segregation of different social groups. They are an embodiment of our utilitarian valuation of nature, our desire for control, our deep-seated xenophobia, and the capitalist, market-regulated societal structure that gives rise to strictly defined property rights.
