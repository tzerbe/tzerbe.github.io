I have a lot of anxieties about climate change. I hate the image that I have in my head of a dying world where biodiversity dwindles and ecosystems slowly degrade and there is no more green and living beings are suffering. I am also anxious about the possibility for climate change to catalyze global conflict.

I recently read an article published in PNAS titled, “Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought,” that really peaked and confirmed my fears. Researchers from UC Santa Barbara and Columbia analyzed the long-term trend of warming in the Fertile Crescent which they concluded was likely not caused by natural forces alone, and it’s impact on the pre-existing geopolitical instability of the area. They suggest that, “human influences on the climate system are implicated in the current Syrian conflict.” I realize that this concern is very anthropocentric. That stresses me out too!! Why am I such a parasite?!

I found that Vanessa Timmer’s presentation on envisioning the future absolved my fears the most (although I wasn’t necessarily looking to thought leaders to do that). What I took out of our dialogue with her was that, on some level, your vision of the future is prophetic. Whatever you envision for the future informs your actions now which, in turn, shapes your future. This re-instilled some of my faith in our collective agency to make change.

I was left wondering how we would envision our collective future together with equal participation on a global scale. One answer to this question is what Roy Bendor and his research team are doing in Sustainability in an Imaginary World! Art and music are incredibly important devices that can be used to accomplish this. Interactive art, especially, has an amazing ability to communicate ideas and feelings to people, which sometimes other medium cannot.
