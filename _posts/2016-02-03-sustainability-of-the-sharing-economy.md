While the sharing economy does not fit the bill entirely on social sustainability, it does have much to offer environmentally sustainable development. [Heinrichs' article](../../../../images/out.pdf) published in GAIA suggests that the sharing economy is a potential new pathway to sustainability. He acknowledges, however, that there has been relatively little academic discourse on the sharing economy, and that the sustainability sciences should look more into the socioenvironmental implications.
