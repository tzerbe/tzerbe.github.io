My Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings are spent between two families that I babysit for. The time I get to spend with the kids is rejuvenating and amazing.

One family has a one-and-a-half year old and a three year old, and the other has an eight year old and an eleven year old. I am totally fascinated by the way children of different ages make sense of the world around them.
