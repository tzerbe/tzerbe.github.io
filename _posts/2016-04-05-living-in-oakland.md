After my first year of university I was at a major crossroads in my life. I left home when I was sixteen for university and hated it. My boyfriend at the time was an artist in residency in Oakland, California. Much to my parents dismay, I decided to take a year off and move to Oakland to be with him.

We lived together in the left side basement of a small Section 8 duplex in East Oakland. Section 8 is a federally subsidized program that attempts to provide affordable housing for renters in market-rate units. We still paid nearly $900 a month in rent. I worked for the Centre for Gender and Refugee Studies (CGRS) and aided research on global humans rights conditions on specific issues pertaining to women and children's rights, as well as LGBT rights and abuses.

About half way through the summer, the Ellis Act reared its ugly head. Ellis is a state law which says that landlords have the unconditional right to evict tenants to “go out of business” and is considered a just cause for eviction. Ellis Act evictions generally are used to change the use of the building. For example, some are used to convert rental units to condominiums, using loopholes in the condo law, and others are used to merge multi-unit buildings into larger single family homes.

Many people we knew were evicted that summer, mostly from the North Oakland area which borders Berkeley, and West Oakland which is very near the first BART station (the San Francisco Bay's rapid transit system) on the East Bay (across from San Francisco). Many people were evicted or forced to move to south to San Leandro or Hayward as there are impenetrable geographic and socio-economic borders to the East, North, and West. The landscape was unimaginably transformed and, in all fairness, we were part of the problem.

Another thing happened that summer that was too macro for me to wrap my 16-year-old head around: BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) went on strike. Personally, I was unable to get to work for nearly two weeks because I worked in San Francisco, I didn't have a car, and you're not allowed to bike over the Golden Gate Bridge. Thus, the only way to get across the bay is by BART. People in the East Bay were left stranded for weeks on end unless they worked for Google, in which case, there was a private bus system that transported them to and from Silicon Valley.

I feel I only really fully understood the significance of all of this when Jackie Wong visited our class in February and spoke with us on the sharing economy. It has left me wondering about the gentrifying power of tech industries, and why the abundance of that industry is not enjoyed more equitably.
