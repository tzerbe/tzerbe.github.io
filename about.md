This is a portal and it takes you inside Thea Zerbe. You see the world through Thea Zerbe's eyes... and then after about 15 minutes, you're spit out... into a ditch on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.

It's supernatural, for lack of a better word. I mean, it raises all sorts of philosophical-type questions, you know... about the nature of self, about the existence of a soul. You know, am I me? Is Thea Thea? Do you see what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is? I don't see how I could go on living my life the way I've lived it before.
